# Planets

## How to use the app

A JavaScript landing page which fetches data from an external API and displays information about the eight planets from our Solar System. The default planet is Earth, and to change it, you can choose the planet you desire by clicking on one of the options from the top of the page and the information displayed is getting changed based on your choice.

## Errors handling

In case an error is occurring when fetching the data, thereâ€™s a message notifying you about that and a button where you can refresh the page.

## Technologies

Technologies I have used to create this project are HTM, CSS and JavaScript and is deployed with GitHub pages.
